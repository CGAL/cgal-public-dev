\section Embree_introduction Introduction

This chapter describes how to use Embree ray tracing kernel for \cgal triangle meshes.
Instead of duplicating the mesh to an Embree mesh representation, we use the `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_USER`
and provide callbacks for the EmbreeAPI. The two major callbacks we provide are for computing a bounding box of a primitve in the mesh and for to compute intersection attibutes between the ray and intersected primitve.

Embree uses vector instructions, intrinsic functionalities and single precision floating point arithmetic, thus it provides
ray shooting queries faster than with the `CGAL::AABB_tree`, but without exactness guaranteed.


\section secEmbreeDefinitions Interface

The main entry point to the component is the class `Embree::AABB_tree`
which represents a static AABB tree constructed from either a Surface_mesh or Polyhedron_3. Once instantiated an AABB tree can be queried for
intersections and distance queries.

\b Intersections. The package currently supports triangle
primitives only. The tree can be queried for intersection against line
objects (rays or segments) in various ways. We have tried to keep the signature 
of functions as similar as possible to AABB_tree package for convenience.

Queries:

- Function `Embree::AABB_tree::do_intersect()` tests if the input primitives are
intersected by the query. This function is fast as it stops after the first encountered intersection.
- Function `Embree::AABB_tree::number_of_intersected_primitives()` gives a count of all
intersected primitives by the query line object.
- Function `Embree::AABB_tree::all_intersected_primitives()` enumerates all intersected
primitives ids. 
- Function `Embree::AABB_tree::any_intersected_primitive()` returns the first
encountered intersecting primitive id (if any) and stops after the first
encountered intersection. Note that the traversal order of the tree is
such that first herein does not refer to any particular ordering of
the intersections with respect to the query.
- Function `Embree::AABB_tree::first_intersected_primitive()` returns
the intersecting primitive id (if any) of the corresponding
intersection object that is closest to the source of the line object.


Constructions:

- Function `Embree::AABB_tree::all_intersections()` detects and constructs all
intersection objects with the input line object.
- Function `Embree::AABB_tree::any_intersection()` detects and constructs the first
encountered intersection and constructs the corresponding object. This
function is fast as it stops after the first encountered intersection.
- Function `Embree::AABB_tree::first_intersection()` detects and constructs
the intersection object that is closest to the source of the ray.

\b Distance. Embree AABB tree also computes the closest point from a
given point query to the input primitives through the function
`Embree::AABB_tree::closest_point()`. In addition, it can compute the id of the
closest primitive from a given point query through the function
`Embree::AABB_tree::closest_point_and_primitive()`, i.e., the id of the
primitive which realizes the minimum distance from the point
query. Unlike like the AABB tree which uses a secondary search structure to speed up the
distance queries, `Embree::AABB_tree` does not require anything other than the Tree object created
for intersection queries. This is possible due to the underlying point query support from the EmbreeAPI.

\section secEmbreeExamples Examples

\subsection subsecEmbreeFirstExample Ray Shooting with Surface_mesh

The following example shows the basics needed to set up a Embree::AABB_tree
using the Embree::Triangle_mesh_geometry structure using a Surface_mesh. Here we call the Embree::AABB_tree::first_intersection()
with a ray query argument. This in turn gives us the 'id' and the point on the primitive which was the
closest from the ray origin in the ray direction.

\cgalExample{Embree/ray_shooting_embree.cpp}

\subsection subsecEmbreeSecondExample Ray Shooting with Polyhedron

The following example shows the basics needed to set up a Embree::AABB_tree
using the Embree::Triangle_mesh_geometry structure using a Polyhedron.

\cgalExample{Embree/polyhedron_embree.cpp}

\subsection subsecEmbreeThirdExample Segment Shooting with Embree.

The following example shows the set up needed to query from a Segment as a query.

\cgalExample{Embree/segment_shooting_embree.cpp}

\subsection subsecEmbreeFourthExample Ray shooting all/any intersections.

The following example shows the set up needed to query all/any type intersections using 
a ray as query.

\cgalExample{Embree/ray_all_any_embree.cpp}

\subsection subsecEmbreeFifthExample Distance querying using Embree::AABB_tree.

The following example shows the set up needed to make distance queries using Embree::AABB_tree.
There is no need to make a seperate accerelating structure like in CGAL::AABB_tree.
