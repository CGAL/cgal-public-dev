\ccPkgSummary{
The problem of finding all tangent lines to four line segments arises in many fields in computation such as computer graphics (visibility computations), computer geometry (line traversal and assembly planning) and computer vision (for object recognition).\newline
The number of tangent lines to four arbitrary line segments in three dimensional Euclidean space is zero to four or infinite.\newline}
