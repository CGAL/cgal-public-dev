The casting ptocess is a form of manufacturing, where liquid material is poured into a mold, it solidifies, and then the object is removed from the mold. The mold has to be designed in such a way that the object can be removed without breaking the mold. This is not always possible (e.g., a sphere).

This package consists of the implementations of various predicates and operations related to catings of objects in space. In particular, it can be used to determine whether a mold for an object does exist. If a mold exists, the package can also used to compute all possible orientations of the feasible molds and their corresponding motions needed to remove the casted object from the mold.
