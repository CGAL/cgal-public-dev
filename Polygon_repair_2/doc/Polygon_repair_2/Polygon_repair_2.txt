\section SectionPolygonRepair2_Introduction Introduction

This package implements a polygon repair method based on a constrained
triangulation \cgalCite{14cg}. Starting from a possibly invalid input
in the form of a polygon, polygon with holes or multipolygon with holes,
the method performs a constrained triangulation of the input edges, labels
each triangle according to what it represents (exterior, polygon interior
or hole), and reconstructs the polygon(s) represented by the triangulation.
The method returns a valid output stored in a multipolygon with holes.

Different triangulation and labelling heuristics are possible, but
currently only the odd-even heuristic is implemented in the package.

\section SectionPolygonRepair2_Definitions Definitions

- A valid <B>polygon</B> (without holes) is a point set in \f$ \mathbb{R}^2\f$
that is bounded by a cycle of linear edges, which is known as its
<B>outer boundary</B>. This outer boundary should be <B>simple</B>,
meaning that the interiors of its edges are pairwise disjoint and all of
its vertices have a degree of two. It is thus topologically equivalent to a
disk and is represented internally as the sequence of points at the common
end points of the edges around its outer boundary.

- A valid <B>polygon with holes</B> is a point set in \f$ \mathbb{R}^2\f$
that is bounded by one outer boundary and zero or more <B>inner boundaries</B>,
where each inner boundary represents a hole in the polygon. Considered by
itself, each boundary should be simple. The different boundaries of a polygon
are allowed to intersect tangentially at their common vertices (with no common
edges), forming vertices with degrees larger than two at the tangential points.
The interior of a polygon with holes should form a connected point set.
Note that a valid polygon can also be represented as a valid polygon with
holes (where the number of holes is zero).

- A valid <B>multipolygon with holes</B> is a point set in \f$ \mathbb{R}^2\f$
that is represented by a set of zero or more valid polygons with holes.
The interiors of the polygons with holes should be pairwise disjoint, but they
are allowed to intersect tangentially at their common vertices. Note that
a valid polygon with holes can also be represented as a valid multipolygon
with holes.

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair2_Output Stricter conditions for output

The conditions listed above are sufficient to define valid polygons, polygons
with holes and multipolygons with holes for most applications. However, in
order to ensure unique deterministic output from the repair algorithm,
the valid multipolygons with holes returned by the package conform to more
strict criteria:

- Adjacent collinear edges touching at vertices of degree two are merged
- The sequence of vertices representing a boundary starts from its
lexicographically smallest vertex
- Outer boundaries are oriented counterclockwise and inner boundaries are
oriented clockwise
- The inner boundaries of a polygon with holes are stored in lexicographic
order
- The polygons with holes of a multipolygon with holes are also stored in
lexicographic order

\section SectionPolygonRepair2_Algorithm Algorithm

Broadly, the algorithm consists of three steps:

-# <B>Constrained triangulation</B>: the edges in the polygon, polygon with
holes or multipolygon with holes are added as constraints in the triangulation.
-# <B>Labeling of the faces</B>: sets of faces forming contiguous regions that
are accessible from each other by following adjacency relationships without
passing through a constrained edge are labeled with ids according to
what they represent (exterior, polygon interior or hole). The faces iteratively
adjacent to the infinite face without passing through a constrained edge are
labeled as the exterior.
-# <B>Reconstruction of the multipolygon</B>: each boundary of each polygon
with holes is reconstructed by finding a polygon interior triangle that is
adjacent to the exterior or a hole, then following the boundary in an
orientation that is counterclockwise for outer boundaries and clockwise for
inner boundaries. This orientation and the polygon interior id is used to
determine what polygon with holes it belongs to and whether it is an outer or
an inner boundary.

FIGURE

If the input is already valid, the method will return a valid output representing
the same area. However, the output might be different in order to conform to the
stricter conditions to generate deterministic output (see
\ref SubsectionPolygonRepair2_Output).

Also, it is worth noting that even the repair of a single polygon without holes
but with self-intersections can result in a multipolygon with holes. This is why
the repair function will always return a multipolygon with holes. The user can
then check whether it consists of a single polygon with holes, and whether this
polygon with holes has zero holes and treat it appropriately.

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair2_OddEven Odd-even repair

The odd-even repair heuristic results in areas that are alternatingly assigned
as polygon interiors and exterior/holes each time that an input edge is passed.
It doesn't distinguish between edges that are part of outer boundaries or inner
boundaries.

FIGURE

In order to generate consistent output, the odd-even heuristic requires it to be
applied to both edges and faces. For the edges, this heuristic means that only
the line segments that are present an odd number of times in the input will be
constrained edges in the triangulation. For the face labels, this heuristic means
that after the exterior faces have been labeled, the other faces will be
alternatingly labeled with polygon interior and hole ids every time that a
constrained edge is passed.

\section SectionPolygonRepair2_Examples Examples

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair2_Multipolygon The multipolygon with holes class

The following example shows the creation of a multipolygon with holes and the traversal
of the polygons in it.

\cgalExample{Polygon_repair_2/multipolygon.cpp}

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair2_WKTDraw Draw a multipolygon

A multipolygon can be visualized by calling the \link PkgPolygonRepair2Ref CGAL::draw<P>() \endlink function as shown in the following example. This function opens a new window showing the given polygon. A call to this function is blocking, that is the program continues as soon as the user closes the window (versions for polygons and polygons with holes also exist, cf. \link PkgDrawPolygon2 CGAL::draw<PH>() \endlink and \link PkgDrawPolygonWithHoles2 CGAL::draw<PH>() \endlink).

\cgalExample{Polygon_repair_2/draw_multipolygon.cpp}

This function requires `CGAL_Qt5`, and is only available if the macro `CGAL_USE_BASIC_VIEWER` is defined.
Linking with the cmake target `CGAL::CGAL_Basic_viewer` will link with `CGAL_Qt5` and add the definition `CGAL_USE_BASIC_VIEWER`.
