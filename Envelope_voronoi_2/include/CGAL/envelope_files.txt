envelope_on_surface_3.h    envelope_3.h 
=======================================
Calls for global functions.

Eos_divide_and_conquer_3.h   Envelope_divide_and_conquer_3.h
============
D&C algorithm.


Comments
========
1) In some places I have added the Envelope_3 namespace. This is an internal 
   namespace that should not be visible to others.


Problems
========
1) How to use the random dividor but still have consistent tests?
   Ophir: I suggest adding it as argument and in test used the "arbitrary".
          I also suggest to change the name to "alternating dividor".
2) Should revise the code using template-template parameters in 
   Envelope_on_surface_diagram_2.h. Consult Efi. In the meantime, I removed it.
3) There is no possibility of using a different DCEL. (Basically, there is no
   such possibility.)
4) global is_valid function does not work in some cases. (SFINAE?)
   Check why and uncomment the is_valid in the envelope package 
   (I have commented some is_valid to make it work).
5) remove HE_COMP_RES.
6) Why is notify_before_global_change()/notify_after_global_change() is in the
   Accessor and not inside the arrangement itself? Who will remember to call 
   this function?
7) is_at_infinity in Envelope_divide_and_conquer --- I am not sure what should 
   be there instead. In the meanwhile, this can leave unneeded vertices on
   the boundary of the parameter space.
