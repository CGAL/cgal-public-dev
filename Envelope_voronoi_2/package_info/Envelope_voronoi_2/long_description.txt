The package is a general framework for implementing two-dimensional 
Voronoi diagrams of different classes of sites under various distance
functions.
The framework is sufficiently general to support diagrams embedded on
a family of two-dimensional parametric surfaces in $R^3$.
The computation of the diagrams is carried out through the
construction of envelopes of surfaces in 3-space provided by CGAL.
The computation of the diagrams employs the Envelope_3 package for 
constructing envelopes of surfaces in 3-space, which implements a 
divide-and-conquer algorithm.
