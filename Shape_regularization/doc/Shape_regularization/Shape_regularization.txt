\section ShapeRegularization_introduction Introduction

The shape regularization algorithm is based on the "Global regularization" algorithm
from the "KIPPI: Kinetic Polygonal Partitioning of Images" article
written by Jean-Philippe Bauchet and Florent Lafarge at Inria - Universite Cote d'Azur.
The shape regularization algorithm works as follows:
 1. Find neighbours for each item in the data set;
 2. Obtain target values between neighbours;
 3. Solve the quadratic programming problem;
 4. Sort items into groups based on the common value;
 5. Apply the values obtained during the regularization process to the items.

Two particular instances of this algorithm are provided:
- \ref ShapeRegularization_2d_regularization "2D" regularization of segments;
- \ref ShapeRegularization_3d_regularization "3D" regularization of planes;

Other instances can be added by the user, as explained below.

\section ShapeRegularization_framework Framework

The main class `CGAL::Regularization::Shape_regularization` is parameterized by
- GeomTraits that specifes the kernel type;
- InputRange that stores a range of user-defined input items;
- NeighborQuery that provides the means for accessing neighbors of an item;
- RegularizationType that determines which regularization type to apply;

The `CGAL::Regularization::Shape_regularization` uses the 
<a href="https://osqp.org/docs/">Operator Splitting Quadratic Program (OSQP) solver</a> 
to solve the quadratic programming problem. The <a href="https://osqp.org/docs/">OSQP solver</a>
is a very efficient QP solver that works with sparce matrices and has an open-source project 
license to any academic or commercial applications.

Using this generic framework, users can regularize any set 
of arbitrary items with their own regularization type. 

\subsection ShapeRegularization_neighborhood Neighborhood

The concept `NeighborQuery` provides the means for accessing neighbors of an item. 
To create a model that respects this concept, the user has to provide an overload of the operator:

- `NeighborQuery::operator()()` that has to fill a vector with indices of all items, which 
are neighbors of the query item.

\subsection ShapeRegularization_regularization_type Regularization type

The concept `RegularizationType` determines the type of regularization which will be applied.
To create a model that respect this concept, three functions have to be defined:

- `RegularizationType::target_value()` This function computes and return the target value
between 2 neighbour items.

- `RegularizationType::bound()` This function returns a bound of a particular item.

- `RegularizationType::update()` This function applies results from the QP solver to the regularized items.

\subsection ShapeRegularization_examples Examples

Here will be examples.

\section ShapeRegularization_2d_regularization 2D Regularization

This CGAL component provides the corresponding models of the concepts 
NeighborQuery and RegularizationType. In particular, it provides a way to define neighbors of a segment:

- `CGAL::Regularization::Delaunay_neighbor_query_2` - This class finds the neighbors of each segment by constructing the 
Delaunay triangulation using the <a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Triangulation_2/index.html#title11">CGAL::Delaunay_triangulation_2</a> class.

In addition to the NeighborQuery class, it provides 2 ways to define RegularizationType:

- `CGAL::Regularization::Angle_regularization_2` - This class re-orients segments to preserve parallelism and orthogonality.
- `CGAL::Regularization::Ordinate_regularization_2` - This class re-aligns segments to preserve collinearity.

\subsection ShapeRegularization_2d_delaunay_neighbor_query Delaunay neighbor query

This class finds the neighbours of each segment by constructing a 
Delaunay triangulation using the <a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Triangulation_2/index.html#title11">CGAL::Delaunay_triangulation_2</a> class.

This class constructs the Delaunay triangulation from a group of segments, which has to be provided by the user
using the `CGAL::Regularization::Delaunay_neighbor_query_2::add_group()` function, and finds neighbors for each segment in the provided group. 
The Delaunay triangulation can be constructed only for a group of minimum 2 segments.

\subsection ShapeRegularization_2d_angle_regularization Angle Regularization

This class re-orients segments to preserve parallelism and orthogonality. 
In order to apply the angle regularization on a set of segments the user has to: 
- Specifiy the angle bound in the constructor. The bound value
for the angle regularization has to be within the \f$[0, 90)\f$ degree interval. If no bound is provided,
a bound of \f$25^{\circ}\f$ will be set as the default value.
- Add groups of segments using the `CGAL::Regularization::Angle_regularization_2::add_group()` function. If the user does not have
specific groups in mind, a vector of all indices of segments from InputRange has to be provided as one group.

In addition to the functionality described above, the user can use the `CGAL::Regularization::Angle_regularization_2::parallel_groups()` 
function to obtain groups of parallel segments which were created during the regularization process. This is important if the user wants
to apply the ordinate regularization thereafter.

Typical usage of the shape regularization algorithm for angle regularization consists of the following steps:
- 1. Define an input range with segments;
- 2. Create instances of the classes `NeighborQuery` and `RegularizationType` with the proper parameters;
- 3. Add groups to the `NeighborQuery` and `RegularizationType`;
- 4. Create an instance of the class `CGAL::Regularization::Shape_regularization`;
- 5. Regularize;
- Optional: obtain groups of parallel segments and clear the instance of the NeighborQuery class if planning to use the
shape regularization algorithm for ordinate regularization.

The following example demonstrates the usage of the shape regularization algorithm for angle regularization 
on a set of 100 randomly generated segments using the 
<a href="https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Generator/index.html">CGAL Geometric Object Generators</a>.
The entire `InputRange` is provided to the Angle regularization class as one group.
The angle regularization bound is set as \f$40^{\circ}\f$.

\subsection ShapeRegularization_2d_ordinate_regularization Ordinate Regularization

This class re-aligns segments to preserve collinearity. 
In order to apply the ordinate regularization on a set of segments the user has to: 
- Specify the ordinate value bound in the constructor. The bound value
for the ordinate regularization has to be within the \f$[0, \infty)\f$ interval. If no bound is provided,
a bound of \f$0.1\f$ will be set as the default value.
- Add groups of parallel segments using the `CGAL::Regularization::Ordinate_regularization_2::add_group()` function. 
If the user does not have parallel groups, the groups might be obtained from the angle regularization class or by using the 
`CGAL::Regularization::Parallel_groups_2` class.

Typical usage of the shape regularization for ordinates consists of the following steps:
- 1. Define an input range with segments;
- 2. Create instances of the classes NeighborQuery and RegularizationType with the proper parameters;
- 3. Obtain groups of parallel segments;
- 4. Add those groups to the NeighborQuery and RegularizationType;
- 5. Create an instance of the class CGAL::Regularization::Shape_regularization;
- 6. Regularize;

The following example demonstrates the usage of the shape regularization algorithm for ordinate regularization 
on a set of 100 parallel segments located in a circle. The `CGAL::Regularization::Parallel_groups_2` class
is used to obtain groups of parallel segments within the \f$1^{\circ}\f$ bound. 
The ordinate regularization bound is set as \f$0.25\f$.

both angle regularization and ordinate regularization sequentially.

<a href="https://cgal.geometryfactory.com/CGAL/doc/master/Shape_detection/index.html#Shape_detection_RegionGrowing">
`CGAL::Shape_detection::Region_growing`</a> algorithm.
The angle and ordinate regularizations are performed on these segments
using bounds of \f$60^{\circ}\f$ and \f$0.95\f$ respectively.

\subsection ShapeRegularization_2d_performance Performance

The shape regularization algorithm is very efficient due to having a linear level of complexity in obtaining the neighbours of 
each element, its target values and constructing the QP solver data. The <a href="https://osqp.org/docs/">OSQP solver</a>
is also highly efficient due to using a custom ADMM-based first-order method requiring only a single matrix 
factorization in the setup phase and implementing custom sparse linear algebra routines exploiting structures in the problem data.

\section ShapeRegularization_utilities Utilities

The following utility classes are provided for the user:

\subsection ShapeRegularization_parallel_groups_2 Parallel groups

The `CGAL::Regularization::Parallel_groups_2` class is created to allow users to form groups of parallel segments
without applying the shape regularization for the angle regularization algorithm. This class is parameterized as follows:
- GeomTraits that specifes the kernel type;
- InputRange that stores a range of user-defined input items;
- SegmentMap that provides the means for accessing items from the InputRange;

In order to create groups of segments based on the principle of parallelism from a set of segments, the user has to:
- set the `tolerance` value within the \f$(0, \infty)\f$ interval. If no value is provided, the `tolerance` is set to
\f$1000000\f$. The greater the `tolerance` value becomes, the lower the grouping angle becomes, i.e. the `tolerance` value of 
\f$1\f$ is equal to the angle bound of \f$1^{\circ}\f$, the `tolerance` value of \f$10\f$ is equal to the angle bound 
of \f$0.1^{\circ}\f$ and etc.

The user can acces the parallel groups using the `CGAL::Regularization::Parallel_groups_2::parallel_groups()` function.

\section ShapeRegularization_history History

The shape regularization algorithm on a 2D segment set was first implemented by Jean-Philippe Bauchet 
and then generalized by Gennadii Sytov during the Google Summer of Code 2019 under the supervision of Dmitry Anisimov.
