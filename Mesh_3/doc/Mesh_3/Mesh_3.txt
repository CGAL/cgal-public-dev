\section Mesh_3_section_intro Introduction

This package is devoted to the generation of isotropic simplicial
meshes discretizing 3D domains.
The domain to be meshed is a region of 3D space, required to be bounded.
The region may be connected or composed of multiple components
and/or subdivided in several subdomains. 

Boundary and subdivision surfaces are either
smooth or piecewise smooth surfaces, formed with planar or curved surface patches.
Surfaces may exhibit 1-dimensional features (e.g. crease edges)
and 0-dimensional features (e.g. singular points as corners
tips, cusps or darts), that have to be fairly
approximated in the mesh.

The output mesh is a 3-dimensional triangulation, 
including subcomplexes that approximate each input domain feature: subdomain,
boundary surface patch or input domain feature with dimension 0 or 1.
Thus, the output mesh includes a 3D submesh covering each subdomain, 
a surface mesh approximating each boundary or subdividing
surface patch, a polyline approximation for each 
1-dimensional feature and 
of course a vertex on each corner.

The main entry points of the package are
two global functions that respectively generate
and refine such meshes.
The mesh generator is customized to output a mesh
that fits as much as possible the user needs,
for instance in terms of sizing field 
or with respect to some user customized quality criteria.

The meshing engine used in this mesh generator
is based on Delaunay refinement \cgalCite{c-gqmgc-93}, \cgalCite{r-draq2d-95}, \cgalCite{s-tmgdr-98}.
It uses the notion of restricted Delaunay triangulation
to approximate 1-dimensional curve segments and surface patches \cgalCite{cgal:bo-pgsms-05}.
Before the refinement, a mechanism of protecting balls is set up on 1-dimensional features, if any,
to ensure a fair representation
of those features in the mesh, and also to guarantee the termination of the refinement process,
whatever may be the input geometry, in particular whatever small angles
the boundary and subdivision surface patches may form \cgalCite{cgal:cdl-pdma-07}, \cgalCite{cgal:cdr-drpsc-07}.
The Delaunay refinement is followed by a mesh optimization phase
to remove slivers and provide a good quality mesh.

Optionally, the meshing and optimization algorithms support multi-core shared-memory 
architectures to take advantage of available parallelism.

\subsection Mesh_3InputDomain Input Domain

The domain to be meshed is assumed to be bounded
and representable as a pure
3D complex. A 3D complex is a set of faces with dimension 0,
1, 2 and 3 such that
all faces are pairwise interior disjoint, 
and the boundary of each face of the complex is the union of faces
of the complex.
The 3D complex is pure, meaning that each face is included in a face of dimension 3,
so that the complex is entirely described by the set of its 3D faces and their subfaces.
However the 3D complex needs not be connected.
The set of faces with dimension lower or equal than 2 forms a 2D
subcomplex which needs not be manifold, neither pure, nor connected:
some 3D faces may have dangling 2D or 1D faces in their boundary faces.

In the rest of the documentation, we will refer to the
input 3D complex as the input domain. The faces of the input domain 
with dimension 0, 1, 2 and 3 are called respectively
<I>corners</I>, <I>curve segments</I>, <I>surface patches</I> and <I>subdomains</I>
to clearly distinguish them from the faces of the mesh
that are called vertices, edges, facets and cells.

Note that the input complex faces are not required to be linear nor smooth.
Surface patches, for instance, may be smooth surface patches, 
or portions of surface meshes with boundaries.
Curve segments may be for instance straight segments, curved segments
or polylines. Each of those features will be accurately represented in the final mesh.

The 0 and 1-dimensional features of the input domain are usually singular points
of the subdomain boundaries, however this is not required. Furthermore those features
are not required to cover all the subdomains boundaries singularities
but only those that need to be accurately represented in the final mesh.
In the following, we say that a domain has <I>features</I> when it has 0 and
1-dimensional features that need to be accurately represented in the mesh,
and we call those features <I>exposed features</I>.
Therefore, a domain may be without features either because all boundary surface patches
are smooth closed surfaces, or simply because the curves joining different surface patches
and the singularities of those patches need not be accurately approximated
in the final mesh.

Note also that input complex faces are not required to be connected.
Faces of the input domain are identified by indexes.
If a subdomain is not connected, its different components receive the same index.
Likewise different surface patches, segment curves or corners may share the same index.
Each connected component of a feature will be accurately represented
in the final mesh.
Note however that the occurrence of multiply connected faces in the
input complex may affect the relevance of internal topological checks
performed by the mesh generator. Also the mesh generator
will not be able to apply different meshing criteria, e.g. different
sizing field, for the different connected components of a single feature.

The domain is input to the mesh generation function,
as a domain class, often called the oracle,
that provides predicates and constructors related to the domain,
the subdomains, the boundary surface patches
and also the 0 and 1-dimensional exposed features, if any.
Mainly, the oracle provides a predicate to test
if a given query point belongs 
to the domain or not
and to find in which subdomain it lies in the affirmative case.
The domain class also provides predicates and constructors to test the intersection of a query line segment
with the boundary surface patches and to build some intersection points if any.
Lastly, if the input domain includes 1-dimensional exposed features, the domain class
provides a way to construct sample points on these features.

The current implementation provides classes to represent
domains bounded by isosurfaces of implicit functions, polyhedral domains
and domains defined through 3D labeled images. 
Currently, 1-dimensional features may be defined as segments and polyline segments.

\subsection Mesh_3OutputMesh Output Mesh

The resulting mesh is output as a subcomplex of a 3D Delaunay triangulation,
in a class providing various iterators
on mesh elements.

The 3D triangulation provides approximations of the
subdomains, surface patches and curve segments
and corners, according to the restricted
Delaunay triangulation paradigm. This means that each subdomain
is approximated by the union of the tetrahedral cells
whose circumcenters are located inside the domain
(or subdomain). 
Each surface patch is approximated 
by the union of the Delaunay mesh facets whose dual Voronoi edges intersect the surface patch.
Such mesh facets are called <I>surface facets</I> in the following. 
The 1-dimensional exposed features are approximated by sequences of mesh edges
and the 0-dimensional exposed features are represented by mesh vertices.

\subsection Mesh_3DelaunayRefinement Delaunay Refinement
\anchor introsecparam

The mesh generation algorithm is mainly a Delaunay refinement process.
The Delaunay refinement is 
preceded by a protecting phase to ensure an accurate representation
of 1-dimensional features if any,
and followed by an optimization phase to achieve a good quality mesh.

The Delaunay refinement process is driven by criteria
concerning either the size and shape of mesh cells 
and surface facets.
The refinement process terminates when there are
no more mesh cells or surface facets violating the criteria.

The criteria are designed to achieve a nice spread of the mesh vertices
while ensuring the termination of the refinement process.
Those criteria may be somehow tuned to the user needs 
to achieve for instance the respect of a sizing field by mesh elements,
some topological conditions on the representation of boundary surfaces in the mesh,
and/or some error bound for the approximation of boundary surfaces.
To some extend, the user may tune the Delaunay refinement 
to a prescribed trade-off
between mesh quality and mesh density. 
The mesh density refers to the number of mesh vertices and cells,
i.e.\ to the complexity of the mesh.
The mesh quality referred to here is measured by the radius edge
ratio of surface facets end mesh cells, where the radius edge ratio of
a simplex (triangle or tetrahedron) is the
the ratio between its circumradius and its shortest edge.

\subsection Mesh_3Protectionof0and1dimensionalExposed Protection of 0 and 1-dimensional Exposed Features

If the domain description includes 0 dimensional features,
the corresponding points are inserted into the Delaunay triangulation 
from the start.

If the domain has 1-dimensional exposed features,
the method of protecting balls \cgalCite{cgal:cdr-drpsc-07}, \cgalCite{cgal:cdl-pdma-07}
is used to achieve an accurate representation of those features in the mesh
and to guarantee that the refinement process terminates
whatever may be the dihedral angles formed by input surface patches incident to a
given 1-feature or the angles formed by two 1-features incident to a 0-feature.

According to this method, the 1-dimensional features are 
sampled with points and covered by protecting balls centered on the sample points,
in such a way that :

-no three balls intersect 

-no pair of balls centered on different 1-features intersect.

The triangulation embedding the mesh is in fact 
a weighted Delaunay triangulation, and the triangulation 
is initialized by the insertion of all the protecting
balls, regarded as weighted points.
The Delaunay refinement process
is then launched as before except that refinement points
are no longer circumcenters but are 
weighted circumcenters.
All Steiner vertices inserted by the refinement process are given a zero weight.

The method guarantees:

1) that each segment joining
two successive centers on a 1-dimensional feature will stay in the triangulation,
thus ensuring an accurate approximation of the 1-dimensional features. 

2) that the refinement process will never try to insert a refinement point in the union of the
protecting balls, which ensures the termination of the refinement process.

\subsection Mesh_3OptimizationPhase Optimization Phase

Any tetrahedron that is quasi degenerate has a big radius edge ratio except
those belonging to the family of slivers. A sliver is easily obtained 
as the convex hull of 4 points close to the equatorial circle of a 3D
ball and roughly equally spread along this circle.
The Delaunay refinement tracks tetrahedra with big radius edge ratio 
and therefore eliminates all kinds of 
badly shaped tetrahedra except slivers.

Therefore, at the end of the refinement process,
some sliver shaped tetrahedra may occur in the mesh.
The optimization phase aims at eliminating slivers.

The optimization phase is a succession of optimization processes,
including possibly a Lloyd smoothing, an odt-smoothing,
a perturber and an exuder.

The Lloyd and odt-smoother are global optimizers
moving the mesh vertices to minimize 
a mesh energy. Those optimizers are described respectively in 
\cgalCite{cgal:dfg-cvtaa-99t}, \cgalCite{cgal:dw-tmgob-02} and in \cgalCite{cgal::c-mssbo-04}, \cgalCite{cgal:acyd-vtm-05}.
In both cases the mesh energy
is the `L1` error resulting from the interpolation 
of the function \f$ f(x) =x^2\f$ by a piecewise linear function.
In the case of the Lloyd smoother,
the interpolation is linear in each Voronoi cell of the set of mesh vertices.
In the case of the odt-smoother, the interpolation is linear in each cell 
of the Delaunay triangulation of the mesh vertices,
hence the name odt which is an abbreviation for *optimal Delaunay triangulation*.

\cgalFigureBegin{mesh_3paraboloid,paraboloid.jpg}
The one dimensional illustration of the mesh energy minimized by Lloyd (right)  and ODT (left) smoothers.
\cgalFigureEnd


The Lloyd optimizer is known to be blind to the occurrence of slivers in the mesh 

while the odt-smoother tends to chase them out.
Both of them are global optimizers, 
meaning that they try to improve
the whole mesh rather than focusing on the worst elements. However, both are empirically known
to be very efficient as a preliminary step of optimization, as they tend to enhance the
efficiency of the perturber and/or exuder applied next, see \cgalFigureRef{figureoptimization} 

The perturber and the exuder focus on improving the worst mesh elements.
The perturber \cgalCite{cgal:tsa-ps3dd-09} improves the meshes by local changes
in the vertices positions
aiming to make sliver disappear. The exuder \cgalCite{cgal:cdeft-slive-00}
chases the remaining slivers by
re-weighting mesh vertices with optimal weights.

Each optimization process can be activated or not, and tuned
according to the user requirements and the available time.
By default, only the perturber and the exuder are activated.

Optimization processes are designed to improve mesh quality. However, beware that such an improvement
is obtained by perturbing mesh vertices and modifying the mesh connectivity which has an impact
on the strict compliance to the refinement criteria. Though a strict compliance to mesh criteria
is granted at the end of the Delaunay refinement, this may no longer be true after
some optimization processes. Also beware that the default behavior does involve some
optimization processes.

The left part shows the distribution of dihedral angles of mesh cells, right after Delaunay refinement (top), after some ODT smoothing (middle) and after perturbation (bottom).

\section Mesh_3_section_interface Interface

\subsection Mesh_3TheGlobalFunctions The Global Functions

A 3D mesh generation process is launched through a call
to one of the two following functions:

\code{.cpp}
template <class C3T3,
class MeshDomain_3,
class MeshCriteria>
C3T3 make_mesh_3(MeshDomain_3 domain, 
                 MeshCriteria criteria,
                 parameters::internal::Features_options features = parameters::features(domain),
                 parameters::internal::Lloyd_options lloyd = parameters::no_lloyd(),
                 parameters::internal::Odt_options odt = parameters::no_odt(),
                 parameters::internal::Perturb_options perturb = parameters::perturb(),
                 parameters::internal::Exude_options exude = parameters::exude()); 

template <class C3T3,
class MeshDomain_3,
class MeshCriteria>
void refine_mesh_3(C3T3& c3t3,
                   MeshDomain_3 domain,
                   MeshCriteria criteria,
                   parameters::internal::Lloyd_options lloyd = parameters::no_lloyd(),
                   parameters::internal::Odt_options odt = parameters::no_odt(),
                   parameters::internal::Perturb_options perturb = parameters::perturb(),
                   parameters::internal::Exude_options exude = parameters::exude()); 
\endcode

The function `make_mesh_3()` generates from scratch a mesh
of the input domain, while the function `refine_mesh_3()` refines
an existing mesh of the input domain. Note that as the protection
of 0 and 1-dimensional features does not rely on Delaunay 
refinement, the function `refine_mesh_3()` has no parameter
to preserve features.

\subsection Mesh_3TheDataStructure The Data Structure

The template parameter `C3T3` is required to be a model of
the concept 
`MeshComplex_3InTriangulation_3`, a data structure devised to
represent a three dimensional complex embedded in a 3D
triangulation. In both functions, an instance of type `C3T3` is used to maintain the current
approximating simplicial mesh 
and to represent the final 3D mesh at the end
of the procedure.

The embedding 3D triangulation is required to be the nested type
`CGAL::Mesh_triangulation_3::type`, provided by the meta functor 
`CGAL::Mesh_triangulation_3`. The type for this triangulation is a 
`CGAL::Regular_triangulation_3` whose vertex and cell base classes 
are respectively models of the concepts `MeshVertexBase_3` and 
`MeshCellBase_3`.


\subsection Mesh_3TheDomainOracleandtheFeaturesParameter The Domain Oracle and the Features Parameter

The template parameter `MeshDomain_3` is required to be a model of
the concept `MeshDomain_3`. The argument `domain` of type
`MeshDomain_3`
is the sole link through which the domain
to be discretized is known by the mesh generation algorithm.

This concept provides, among others,
member functions to test whether or not
a query segment intersects boundary surfaces,
and to compute an intersection point in the affirmative.
The `MeshDomain_3` concept adds member functions 
which given a query point tell whether the point lies
inside or outside the domain and in which subdomain the point lies
if inside.

If the domain description includes 0 and 1-dimensional features
that have to be accurately represented in the final mesh,
the template parameter `MeshDomain_3` is required to be 
of a model of the refined concept
`MeshDomainWithFeatures_3`. Mainly 
the concept `MeshDomainWithFeatures_3` provides
the incidence
graph of 0, 1 and 2-dimensional features,
and a member function to construct
sample points on curve segments.

Using the parameter of type `Features`, the user
whose domain is a model of `MeshDomainWithFeatures_3` 
can choose to have the corners and curve segments of the domain
represented in the mesh or not.
The type `Features` of this parameter is an internal undescribed type.
The library provides functions to construct appropriate values of that type.
<UL>
<LI>`parameters::features(domain)` sets `features` according to the domain,
i.e.\ 0 and 1-dimensional features are taken into account if `domain` is a
`MeshDomainWithFeatures_3` 
<LI>`parameters::no_features()` prevents the representation 
of 0 and 1-dimensional features in the mesh. This is useful to get a smooth and rough approximation
of a domain with features.
</UL>

\subsection Mesh_3TheMeshingCriteria The Meshing Criteria

The template parameter `MeshCriteria` must be a model of the concept
`MeshCriteria_3`, or a model of the refined concept `MeshCriteriaWithFeatures_3`
if the domain has exposed features.
The argument of
type `MeshCriteria` passed to the mesh generator specifies the
size and shape requirements for the tetrahedra in the mesh
and for the triangles in the boundary surface mesh. These criteria
condition the rules that drive the refinement process. At the end 
of the refinement process, mesh elements satisfy the criteria.
This may not be strictly true anymore after the optimization phase, but this
last phase is devised to only improve the mesh quality.

The criteria for surface facets are governed by the four following
parameters:
<UL>
<LI><I>`facet_angle`.</I> This parameter controls the shape of 
surface facets. Actually, it is a lower bound for the angle (in degree) of
surface facets. When boundary surfaces are smooth, the termination of the meshing process is
guaranteed if the angular bound is at most 30
degrees. 
<LI><I>`facet_size`.</I> This parameter controls the size of surface facets. 
Actually, each surface facet has 
a surface Delaunay ball which is a ball circumscribing the surface facet and
centered on the surface patch. The parameter `facet_size` is
either a constant or a spatially variable scalar field, providing an 
upper bound for the radii of surface Delaunay balls.
<LI><I>`facet_distance`.</I> This parameter controls the approximation error of boundary and subdivision surfaces.
Actually, it is
either a constant or a spatially variable scalar field. It
provides an upper bound for the distance between the circumcenter
of a surface facet and the center of a surface Delaunay ball of this facet.
<LI><I>`facet_topology`.</I> This parameters controls the set of topological constraints
which have to be verified by each surface facet. By default, each vertex of a surface
facet has to be located on a surface patch, on a curve segment, or on a corner. It can
also be set to check whether the three vertices of a surface facet belongs to the same
surface patch. This has to be done cautiously, as such a criteria needs that each surface
patches intersection is an input 1-dimensional feature.
</UL>

The criteria for mesh cells are governed by two parameters:
<UL>
<LI><I>`cell_radius_edge_ratio`.</I> This parameter controls the
shape of mesh cells (but can't filter slivers, as we discussed earlier).
Actually, it is an upper bound for the ratio
between the circumradius of a 
mesh tetrahedron and its shortest edge.
There is a theoretical bound for this parameter:
the Delaunay refinement process is guaranteed to terminate
for values of `cell_radius_edge_ratio` bigger than 2.
<LI><I>`cell_size`.</I>
This parameter controls the size of mesh tetrahedra.
It is either a scalar or a spatially variable scalar field.
It provides an upper bound on the circumradii of the
mesh tetrahedra. 
</UL>

\cgalFigureRef{figureparameters} shows how the mesh generation process
behaves with respect to these parameters.

achieving a precise approximation. Bottom right : the mesh is obtained
from the previous one by fixing <I>radius bound</I> of surface facets
to \f$ 0.01\f$. The surface mesh is then denser to achieve the size
bound.
\cgalFigureCaptionEnd

If the domain has 1-dimensional exposed features, the `criteria` includes
a sizing field to guide 
the sampling of 1-dimensional features with protecting balls centers.
<UL>
<LI><I>`edge_size`</I>. This constant or variable scalar field is used as an upper bound for the distance between two 
protecting ball centers that are consecutive on a 1-feature. This parameter has to be set to a positive value when  
1-dimensional features protection is used.
</UL>

\subsection Mesh_3TheOptimizationParameters The Optimization Parameters

The four additional parameters are optimization parameters.
They control which optimization processes are performed
and allow the user to tune the parameters of the activated optimization processes.
These parameters have internal types which are not described
but the library provides global functions to generate
appropriate values of these types:
<UL>
<LI>`parameters::lloyd()` and `parameters::no_lloyd()` activate and deactivate the Lloyd smoother.
<LI>`parameters::odt()` and `parameters::no_odt()` activate and deactivate the odt-smoother.
<LI>`parameters::perturb()` and `parameters::no_perturb()` activate and deactivate the perturber.
<LI>`parameters::exude()` and `parameters::no_exude()` activate and deactivate the exuder.
</UL>

These parameters are optional and can be passed in any order.
If one parameter is not passed the default value is used. By default,
only the perturber and the exuder are activated.
Note that whatever may be the optimization processes activated by `make_mesh_3()`
or `refine_mesh_3()`,
they are always launched in the order that is a suborder 
of the following:
*odt smoother*, *Lloyd smoother*, *perturber* and 
*exuder*.

The package also provides four global functions to launch
each optimization process independently. These functions are useful for advanced experimentation 
on the efficiency of each optimization method.
Note however that the exuder adds on mesh vertices weights that are conditioned by vertices
positions. 
Therefore an exudation process should never be run before
a smoother or a perturber. 
For a maximum efficiency, whatever may be the optimization processes activated,
they should be launched in the order that is a suborder 
of the following:
*odt-smoother*, *Lloyd-smoother*, *perturber*,
*exuder*.

\code{.cpp}

template< class C3T3, class MeshDomain_3 >
Mesh_optimization_return_code lloyd_optimize_mesh_3(C3T3& c3t3, MeshDomain_3 domain);

template< class C3T3, class MeshDomain_3 >
Mesh_optimization_return_code odt_optimize_mesh_3(C3T3& c3t3, MeshDomain_3 domain);

template< class C3T3, class MeshDomain_3 >
Mesh_optimization_return_code perturb_mesh_3(C3T3& c3t3, MeshDomain_3 domain);

template< class C3T3 >
Mesh_optimization_return_code exude_mesh_3(C3T3& c3t3);

\endcode


Note that the global functions activating the optimization processes or launching
those processes have themselves parameters (see details in reference pages) to tune the optimization process.

\subsection Mesh_3ParallelAlgorithms Parallel Algorithms

Enabling parallel meshing and optimization algorithms is achieved through 
setting the third template parameter of the `Mesh_triangulation_3` class  
to `Parallel_tag`, when defining the triangulation type. 
Note that when the user provides his/her own vertex and 
cell base classes, the `MeshVertexBase_3` and 
`MeshCellBase_3` concepts impose additionnal requirements.

Parallel algorithms require the executable to be linked against the 
<a href="http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org">Intel TBB library</a>.
To control the number of threads used, the user may use the tbb::task_scheduler_init class.
See the <a href="http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/documentation">TBB documentation</a> 
for more details.

\subsection Mesh_3TuningMeshOptimization Tuning Mesh Optimization

\anchor Mesh_3_subsection_examples_optimization

In the previous examples, the mesh generation is launched through a call
`make_mesh_3()` with a minimal number of parameters. In such cases, 
the default optimization strategy is applied: after the Delaunay refinement process
two optimization steps are performed, a perturbation and a sliver exudation.
The following examples show how to disable default optimization steps 
and how to tune the parameters of optimization steps.

\subsubsection Mesh_3DisablingExudationandTuningPerturbation Disabling Exudation and Tuning Perturbation

In this first example, we show how to disable the exudation step.
The optimization phase after the refinement includes only
a perturbation phase which is launched with no time bound
and an objective of 10 degrees for the minimum dihedral angle
of the mesh.
The example shows two ways of achieving the same result. The first way
issues a single call to `make_mesh_3()` with the required optimization 
process activated and tuned. In the second way, `make_mesh_3()` is first called
without any optimization process and the resulting mesh is next optimized
through a call to `perturb_mesh_3()` with tuned parameters.

\cgalExample{Mesh_3/mesh_optimization_example.cpp}

\subsubsection Mesh_3UsingLloydGlobalOptimization Using Lloyd Global Optimization

In this second example, we show how to call the Lloyd optimization on the
mesh, followed by a call to exudation. We set a time bound of 30s for the Lloyd optimization. 
We set a time bound of 10s and a sliver bound of 10 degrees for the exuder.

\section Mesh_3Performances Performance

We provide here some benchmarks of the performance of the mesh generation algorithms.

\subsection Mesh_3DelaunayRefinement_1 Delaunay Refinement

The computer used for benchmarking is a PC running Linux64 with two Intel Xeon CPU X5450 clocked at 3.00 GHz
with 32GB of RAM. The program has been compiled with g++ v4.3.2 with the -O3 option. 
These benchmarks have been done using \cgal v3.8.
Note that these benchmarks were obtained with the sequential version of the algorithm, 
which does not take advantage of multi-core architectures. See the next 
section for performance of parallel algorithms.

We study the refinement part of the mesh generation engine in this section. We
give the CPU time (measured by `Timer`) using the 3 provided oracles. In all experiments, we produce well
shaped elements: we set the facet angle bound and the radius edge bound to their
theoretical limit (resp. 30 degrees and 2). We also use the same uniform sizing field for facets
and cells.

We mesh an analytical sphere of radius 1.

\section Mesh_3DesignAndImpl Design and Implementation History

\subsection Mesh_3TheoreticalFoundations Theoretical Foundations

The \cgal mesh generation package implements a meshing engine based 
on the method of Delaunay refinement introduced by Chew \cgalCite{c-gqmgc-93} and Ruppert \cgalCite{r-draq2d-95}
and pioneered in 3D by Shewchuk \cgalCite{s-tmgdr-98}. 
It uses the notion of restricted Delaunay triangulation
to approximate 1-dimensional curved features and curved surface patches
and rely on the work of Boissonnat and Oudot \cgalCite{cgal:bo-pgsms-05}
and Oudot et al. \cgalCite{cgal:ory-mvbss-05}
to achieve accurate representation of boundary and subdividing surfaces in the mesh.
The mechanism of protecting balls, used to ensure a fair representation
of 1-dimensional features, if any, and the termination of the refinement process
whatever may be the input geometry, in particular whatever small dihedral angles may form
the boundary and subdivision surface patches,
was pioneered by Cheng et al. \cgalCite{cgal:cdr-drpsc-07} and further experimented by Dey, Levine et al.
\cgalCite{cgal:cdl-pdma-07}.
The optimization phase involves global optimization processes, a perturbation process
and a sliver exudation process. The global optimizers are based on Lloyd smoothing \cgalCite{cgal:dfg-cvtaa-99t}, \cgalCite{cgal:dw-tmgob-02}
and odt smoothing \cgalCite{cgal::c-mssbo-04}, \cgalCite{cgal:acyd-vtm-05}, where odt means
<I>optimal Delaunay triangulation</I>. The perturbation process 
is mainly based on the work of Tournois \cgalCite{cgal:t-om-09}
and Tournois et al. \cgalCite{cgal:twad-iropitmg-09},
while the exudation process is, the now famous, optimization by weighting described
in Edelsbrunner et al. \cgalCite{cgal:cdeft-slive-00}.

\subsection Mesh_3ImplementationHistory Implementation History

Work on the package `Mesh_3` started during the PhD thesis of Laurent Rineau
advised by Mariette Yvinec. A code prototype, together
with a first version of design and specifications \cgalCite{cgal:ry-gsddrm-06}
came out of their collaboration.

From the beginning of 2009, most of the work has been performed by Stéphane
Tayeb, in collaboration with Mariette Yvinec, Laurent Rineau, Pierre Alliez and Jane Tournois.
First, Stéphane released the first public version of the package, implementing the specifications
written by Laurent and Mariette.

The optimization processes are
heavily based on the work of Jane Tournois and Pierre Alliez
during the PhD of Jane advised by Pierre. The optimization phase was imported
in the mesh generation package by Stéphane Tayeb
and appeared first in release 3.6 of \cgal.

In collaboration with Laurent Rineau, Stéphane also added demos and examples.
After some experiments on medical imaging data performed by
Dobrina Boltcheva et al. \cgalCite{cgal:byb-mgmmi-09}, \cgalCite{cgal:-byb-fpdmgmmi-09}, the handling
of 1-dimensional features was worked out by Laurent Rineau, Stéphane Tayeb
and Mariette Yvinec. It appeared first in the release 3.8 of \cgal.

In 2013, Clément Jamin made the meshing and optimization algorithms parallel
on multi-core shared-memory architectures.
