Planar Parameterization of Triangulated Surface Meshes

Parameterizing a surface amounts to finding a one-to-one mapping from a
suitable domain to the surface. In this package, we focus on triangulated
surfaces that are homeomorphic to a disk and on piecewise linear mappings
into a planar domain.

This CGAL package implements some of the state-of-the-art surface mesh parameterization
methods, such as Least Squares Conformal Maps, Discrete Conformal Map,
Discrete Authalic Parameterization, Floater Mean Value Coordinates or
Tutte Barycentric Mapping.

The package proposes currently an interface with CGAL Polyhedron_3 data structure.

Since parameterizing meshes require efficient representation of sparse matrices
and efficient iterative or direct linear solvers, we provide links to standard
libraries (Eigen3) and propose a separate package devoted to OpenNL
sparse linear solver (Levy).
