\section SectionPolygonRepair_Introduction Introduction

This package implements a polygon repair method based on a constrained
triangulation \cgalCite{14cg}. Starting from a possibly invalid input
in the form of a polygon, polygon with holes or multipolygon with holes,
the method performs a constrained triangulation of the input edges, labels
each triangle according to what it represents (exterior, polygon interior
or hole), and reconstructs the polygon(s) represented by the triangulation.
The method returns a valid output stored in a multipolygon with holes.

Different triangulation and labelling heuristics are possible, but
currently only the odd-even heuristic is implemented in the package.
This heuristic results in areas that are alternately assigned as polygon
interiors and exterior/holes each time that an input edge is passed.
It doesn't distinguish between edges that are part of outer boundaries
from those of inner boundaries.

\section SectionPolygonRepair_Definitions Definitions

- A valid <B>polygon</B> (without holes) is a point set in \f$ \mathbb{R}^2\f$
that is bounded by a cycle of linear edges, which is known as its
<B>outer boundary</B>. This outer boundary should be <B>simple</B>,
meaning that the interiors of its edges are pairwise disjoint and all of
its vertices have a degree of two. It is thus topologically equivalent to a
disk and is represented internally as the sequence of points at the common
end points of the edges around its outer boundary.

- A valid <B>polygon with holes</B> is a point set in \f$ \mathbb{R}^2\f$
that is bounded by one outer boundary and zero or more <B>inner boundaries</B>,
where each inner boundary represents a hole in the polygon. Considered
independently, each boundary should be simple. The different boundaries of a polygon
are allowed to intersect tangentially at their common vertices (with no common
edges), forming vertices with degrees of a multiple of two the tangential points.
The interior of a polygon with holes should form a connected point set.
Note that a valid polygon can also be represented as a valid polygon with
holes (where the number of holes is zero).

- A valid <B>multipolygon with holes</B> is a point set in \f$ \mathbb{R}^2\f$
that is represented by a set of zero or more valid polygons with holes.
The interiors of the polygons with holes should be pairwise disjoint, but they
are allowed to intersect tangentially at their common vertices. Note that
a valid polygon with holes can also be represented as a valid multipolygon
with holes (with only one polygon).

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Output Stricter Conditions for Output

The conditions listed above are sufficient to define valid polygons, polygons
with holes and multipolygons with holes for most applications. However, in
order to ensure unique deterministic output from the repair algorithm,
the valid multipolygons with holes returned by the package conform to more
strict criteria:

- Adjacent collinear edges touching at vertices of degree two are merged
- The sequence of vertices representing a boundary starts from its
lexicographically smallest vertex
- Outer boundaries are oriented counter-clockwise and inner boundaries are
oriented clockwise
- The inner boundaries of a polygon with holes are stored in lexicographic
order
- The polygons with holes of a multipolygon with holes are also stored in
lexicographic order

\section SectionPolygonRepair_Algorithm Algorithm

Broadly, the algorithm consists of three steps:

-# <B>Constrained triangulation</B>: the edges in the polygon, polygon with
holes or multipolygon with holes are added as constraints in the triangulation.
-# <B>Labeling of the faces</B>: sets of faces forming contiguous regions that
are accessible from each other by following adjacency relationships without
passing through a constrained edge are labeled with ids according to
what they represent (exterior, polygon interior or hole). The faces iteratively
adjacent to the infinite face without passing through a constrained edge are
labeled as the exterior.
-# <B>Reconstruction of the multipolygon</B>: each boundary of each polygon
with holes is reconstructed by finding a polygon interior triangle that is
adjacent to the exterior or a hole, then following the boundary in an
orientation that is counter-clockwise for outer boundaries and clockwise for
inner boundaries. This orientation and the polygon interior id is used to
determine what polygon with holes it belongs to and whether it is an outer or
an inner boundary.

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Triangulation Constrained triangulation

For the purposes of the repair operation, the input polygon, polygon with holes
or multipolygon is merely used as a container of input line segments. These line
segments are added to the constrained triangulation as constraints.

With the odd-even heuristic, only the edges that are present an odd number of
times in the input will be constrained edges in the triangulation.
When these edges are only partially overlapping, only the parts that overlap
an odd number of times will be constrained edges in the triangulation.

This procedure is done in two steps: 1. preprocessing to eliminate identical
edges that are present an even number of times, and 2. an odd-even constraint
counting mechanism that erases existing constraints when new overlapping ones
are added.

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Labeling Labeling

First, all of the polygon exterior is labeled. For this, the faces that can be
accessed by following the adjacency relationships from the infinite face without
passing through a constrained edge are labeled as exterior faces.

Then, with the odd-even heuristic, groups of faces that are adjacent to each other
without passing through a constrained edge are labeled. The label applied alternates
between polygon interior and hole every time that a constrained edge is passed.

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Reconstruction Reconstruction of the multipolygon

The algorithm reconstructs the multipolygon boundary by boundary, repeating the
process until all boundaries have been reconstructed.
Starting from a triangulation face with a polygon interior label that is adjacent
to a face with an exterior or hole label, the boundary of the polygon that contains
the edge between the two triangles is reconstructed.
The successive edges of the boundary is obtained by rotating counter-clockwise
around their common vertex, resulting in counter-clockwise cycles for outer
boundaries and clockwise cycles for inner boundaries.

Finally, the boundaries are assembled into multipolygons using the unique labels
to know which polygon inner/outer boundaries belong to, and using the orientation
to distinguish between outer and inner boundaries.

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Notes Notes on the Output

If the input is already valid, the method will return a valid output representing
the same area. However, the output might be different in order to conform to the
stricter conditions to generate deterministic output (see
\ref SubsectionPolygonRepair_Output).

Also, it is worth noting that even the repair of a single polygon without holes
but with self-intersections can result in a multipolygon with holes. This is why
the repair function will always return a multipolygon with holes. The user can
then check whether it consists of a single polygon with holes, and if a polygon
with holes has zero holes and extract these if needed.

\section SectionPolygonRepair_Examples Examples

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Multipolygon The multipolygon with holes class

The following example shows the creation of a multipolygon with holes and the traversal
of the polygons in it.

\cgalExample{Polygon_repair/multipolygon.cpp}

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_WKTDraw Draw a multipolygon

A multipolygon with holes can be visualized by calling the \link PkgPolygonRepairRef
CGAL::draw<MPH>() \endlink function as shown in the following example.
This function opens a new window showing the given polygon. A call to this function
is blocking, that is the program continues as soon as the user closes the window.
Versions for polygons and polygons with holes also exist, cf. \link PkgDrawPolygon2
CGAL::draw<P>() \endlink and \link PkgDrawPolygonWithHoles2 CGAL::draw<PH>() \endlink.

The multipolygon with holes shown in this example is created using the well-known text
(WKT) reader, which can read and write multipolygons with holes.

\cgalExample{Polygon_repair/draw_multipolygon.cpp}

This function requires `CGAL_Qt5`, and is only available if the macro
`CGAL_USE_BASIC_VIEWER` is defined. Linking with the cmake target
`CGAL::CGAL_Basic_viewer` will link with `CGAL_Qt5` and add the definition
`CGAL_USE_BASIC_VIEWER`.

\subsection SubsectionPolygonRepair_Repair Repairing a (multi)polygon

It's possible to repair a polygon, polygon with holes or multipolygon with holes
using the odd-even rule by calling the `repair_odd_even` function as shown in the
following example. This function returns a repaired multipolygon with holes.

using a bridge edge (b) After repair: the same area represented as a polygon with
a hole.

to extract the labeled triangulation, which is written as a GeoJSON file consisting
of the individual triangles with their labels.
