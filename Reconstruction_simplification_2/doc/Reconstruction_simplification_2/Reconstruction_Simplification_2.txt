\section Reconstruction_simplification_2Introduction Introduction

This package implements a method to reconstruct and simplify 2D point sets \cgalCite{degoes:hal-00758019}. The input is a set of 2D points with mass attributes, possibly hampered by noise and outliers. The output is a set of line segments and isolated points which approximate the input points, as illustrated in Figure \cgalFigureRef{2D_Reconstruction_Simplification_summary}. The mass attribute relates to the importance given to each point for approximation.

Internally, the algorithm constructs an initial 2D Delaunay triangulation from all the input points, then simplifies the triangulation so that a subset of the edges and vertices of the triangulation approximate well the input points. Approximate herein refers to a robust distance based on optimal transportation (see advanced section for more details). The triangulation is simplified using a combination of half edge collapse operators and edge flips. The triangulation remains valid during simplification, i.e., with neither overlaps nor fold-overs. 

The output of the reconstruction algorithm is a subset of edges and vertices of the triangulation. Figure \cgalFigureRef{2D_Reconstruction_Simplification_algorithm} depicts an example where the output is composed of green edges and one isolated vertex. The green edges are considered relevant as they approximate well many of the input points. The edges depicted in grey, referred to as ghost edges and discarded, approximate none of the input points. The edges depicted in red, referred to as irrelevant and also discarded, approximate some of the input points but not enough to be considered relevant.

\subsection Reconstruction_simplification_2Simplest_example Simplest Example
The following example first reads a set of input points from an ASCII file. The points, with no mass attribute, are then passed to the Reconstruction_simplification_2 object. After initializing it, 100 iterations of the reconstruction process are performed. 
\cgalExample{Reconstruction_simplification_2/rs2_simplest_example.cpp}

\subsubsection Reconstruction_simplification_2Output_example Output Example
The output of the reconstruction can be obtained in two ways: either as a sequence of points and segments, or as an indexed format when the connectivity of the segments is encoded, hence the terms vertices and edges. The indexed format records a list of points, then pairs of point indices in the said list for the edges, and point indices for isolated vertices.

\subsection Reconstruction_simplification_2Mass_example Example with Mass Attributes
The following example first reads a set of input points and masses from an ASCII file. Using two property maps,  the points and their initial mass are passed to the Reconstruction_simplification_2 object. After initializing it, 100 iterations of the reconstruction process are performed. Lastly, the segments and isolated points of the reconstructed shape are extracted and printed to the console.

\section Reconstruction_simplification_2API API

The only class exposed to the user is the <I> Reconstruction_simplification_2 </I>  class.

\subsection Reconstruction_simplification_2Sample Sample Call

\code{.cpp}
/*
K : a geometric kernel.
*/

Reconstruction_simplification_2<K>
  rs2(points.begin(), points.end());

rs2.run(100); // perform 100 contraction steps
\endcode

In case the input is not just points without masses, one can provide 
property maps that match his input.
\code{.cpp}
/*

Point_property_map : a PropertyMap for accessing the input points.
Mass_property_map  : a PropertyMap for accessing the mass attributes of the 
                     input points.
*/

Reconstruction_simplification_2<K, Point_property_map, Mass_property_map>
  rs2(points.begin(), points.end(), point_pmap, mass_pmap);

rs2.run(100); // perform 100 contraction steps
\endcode

Alternatively to calling \link Reconstruction_simplification_2::run run \endlink, 
one can call \link Reconstruction_simplification_2::run_until run_until \endlink
and specify the number of output vertices one wants to keep as illustrated in
Figure \cgalFigureRef{2D_Reconstruction_Simplification_twenty_vertices}.
\code{.cpp}
  rs2.run_until(20); // perform edge contractions until only 20 vertices are left.
\endcode

\subsection Reconstruction_simplification_2Global_relocation Global Point Relocation

Since noise and missing data may prevent the reconstructed shape to have sharp
corners at the correct places, the algorithm offers a function to relocate 
all points:
\code{.cpp}
  rs2.relocate_all_points();
\endcode
The new point locations are chosen such that the approximation of the output segments and isolated points to the input points is improved.

\section Reconstruction_simplification_2Parameters User parameters

The behavior of the algorithm is controlled via the following parameters. 

\subsection Reconstruction_simplification_2Flip Edge Flipping

During simplification of the internal triangulation some recursive edge flip operators are required to guarantee that the triangulation remain valid when applying a half edge collapse operator (see Figure \cgalFigureRef{2D_Reconstruction_Simplification_edgeflip}). Calling set_use_flip(false) prevents the algorithm from using edge flips, yielding shorter computational times at the price of suboptimal results as not all edges can be considered for being collapsible.

\cgalFigureBegin{2D_Reconstruction_Simplification_edgeflip,edgeflip.jpg}

\cgalFigureEnd

\subsection Reconstruction_simplification_2Relevance Edge Relevance

An edge is relevant from the approximation point of view if (1) it is long, (2) approximates a large number of points (or a large amount of mass when points have mass attributes), and (3) has a small approximation error. The notion of relevance is defined as \f$ m(e) * |e|^2 / cost(e) \f$, where \f$ m(e) \f$ denotes the mass of the points approximated by the edge, \f$ |e| \f$ denotes the edge length and \f$ cost(e) \f$ its approximation error. As the error is defined by mass time squared distance the relevance is unitless.
The default value is 0, so that all edges approximating some input points are considered relevant. A larger relevance value provides a means to increase resilience to outliers.


\subsection Reconstruction_simplification_2Random Random Sample Size

By default the simplification relies upon an exhaustive priority queue of half edge collapse operators during decimation. For improved efficiency, a parameter <I> sample size </I> strictly greater than 0 switches to a multiple choice approach, i.e., a best-choice selection in a random sample of edge collapse operators, of size sample_size. A typical value for the sample size is 15, but this value must be enlarged when targeting a very coarse simplification. 

\subsection Reconstruction_simplification_2Local_relocation Local Point Relocation

In addition to the global relocation function an optional parameter of the constructor of the <I> Reconstruction_simplification_2 </I> class provides a means to relocate the points locally after a specified number of atomic simplification operators. The new local point locations are chosen such that the approximation of the output segments and isolated points to the input points is improved. 

\subsection Reconstruction_simplification_2Verbose Verbose Output

The verbose parameter, between 0 and 2, determines how much console output the algorithm generates. A 0 value generates no output to the standard output. A value greater than 0 generates output to the standard output std::cerr.


\section Reconstruction_simplification_2Robustness Robustness
A virtue of the algorithm is its robustness to noise and outliers. 
Figure \cgalFigureRef{2D_Reconstruction_Simplification_robustness} shows that
the output of the algorithm is hardly affected by noise and/or outliers.

\section Reconstruction_simplification_2Density Variable Density
Figure \cgalFigureRef{2D_Reconstruction_Simplification_density} illustrates the behavior of the algorithm on a point set with uniform mass attributes, and variable density. As the algorithm gives more importance to densely sampled areas, this translates into smaller edges on densely sampled areas. On sparsely sampled areas the algorithm initially approximates each point by one isolated vertex, then progressively approximates the points with edges.

\section Reconstruction_simplification_2Mixed Mixed Dimension
Figure \cgalFigureRef{2D_Reconstruction_Simplification_mixed} depicts an input point set sampling a set of line segments and a solid area. Depending on the targeted number of points in the output, the solid area is approximated by a set of evenly sampled isolated vertices.

\section Reconstruction_simplification_2Variable_mass Variable Mass

The mass attributes provides a means to adjust the importance given to each point for approximation. Figure \cgalFigureRef{2D_Reconstruction_Simplification_variable} depicts a reconstruction from a gray level image after thresholding, where the gray level of the pixels are used as mass attribute.

\section Reconstruction_simplification_2HowDoesItWork How does it work?

The task addressed here is to reconstruct a shape from a noisy point set \f$ S \f$ in  \f$ \mathbb{R}^2 \f$, i.e., given a set of points in the plane, find a set of points and segments (more formally, a <I> 0-1 simplicial complex </I>) which best approximates \f$ S \f$. 

The approximation error is derived from the theory of optimal transportation between geometric measures. More specifically, the input point set is seen as a discrete measure, i.e., a set of pointwise masses. The goal is to find a 0-1 simplicial complex where the edges are the support of a piecewise uniform measure (line density of masses) and the vertices are the support of a discrete measure. Approximating the input point set in our context translates into approximating the input discrete measure by another measure composed of line segments and points.

The algorithm performs a fine to coarse simplification of a triangulation. It starts by putting a bounding box around the input points \f$S\f$ and computes the Delaunay Triangulation  \f$  T_0  \f$  on a subset of \f$  S \f$. \f$ T_0 \f$ is the first output simplex, which is simplified in subsequent iterations by repeated edge collapses. To chose the next edge, a collapse operator is simulated for each feasible edge, i.e., edges which introduce neither overlaps nor fold-overs in the triangulation. The next edge \f$ e \f$ for collapse is chosen according to the overall cost of the transportation plan for \f$ T \setminus e \f$, where the cheapest overall cost is preferred. Since disregarding edges which do not preserve the embedding of the triangulation can severely affect the performance of the greedy approach to optimal transport, the collapse operator is modified by adding a local flip procedure which makes every edge collapsible.

The transportation plan is approximated by assigning each input point temporarily to the closest simplex edge. After this partitioning of the input points w.r.t. the edges, all the points temporarily assigned to a given edge are being assigned to it permanently if and only if the corresponding transportation costs are less than the transportation cost for each of the two vertices of the edge. Otherwise each of the points is assigned to the cheaper of the two vertices. This process of edge contraction and transportation plan update is repeated until the desired number of vertices, specified by the users, has been reached. After that, edges which carry little mass can be filtered out and the remaining edges are reported as reconstructing the input shape.
