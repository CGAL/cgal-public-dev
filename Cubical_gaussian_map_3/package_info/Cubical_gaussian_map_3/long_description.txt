This package contains an exact implementation of an efficient data
structure that we call the Cubical Gaussian Map. The cubical Gaussian
map, a dual representation of a convex polytope in 3D, consists of six
planar maps that correspond to the six faces of the unit cube---the
parallel-axis cube circumscribing the unit sphere.  The implementation
is mainly based on the Arrangement package of CGAL. The package also
containes an exact implementation of an efficient algorithm that
computes the Minkowski sums of convex polyhedra in R3 using the
cubical Gaussian maop data structure. The implementation is complete
in the sense that it does not assume general position; namely, it can
handle degenerate input, and it produces exact results. This method is
significantly faster than naive approach that computes the convex hull
of the pairwise sums of vertices of the input two convex polyhedra.
