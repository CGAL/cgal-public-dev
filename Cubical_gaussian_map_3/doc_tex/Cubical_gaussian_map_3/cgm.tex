\section{Introduction}
\label{CGM_sec:intro}

{\em Cubical Gaussian Map} (CGM) is a basic data dtructure that represents a
Gaussinal map mapped onto a unit cube (an axes parallel cube centered at the
origin whose edges are of length two). {\em Polyhedral CGM} is a data dtructure
that represents a 3D convex polyhedron. It is derived from the CGM data
structure. {\em Spherical CGM} is a data structure that represents an
2D arrangement on the surface of the unit sphere.

\section{CGM}
The baseic CGM data structure consists of six planar maps that
correspond to the six faces of the unit cube. The faces are indexed 0 to 5,
where 0, 1, and 2 refer to the faces that reside in the negative X, Y, and Z
halfspaces respectively. In a similar way 3, 4, and 5 refer to the faces that
reside in the positive X, Y, and Z halfspaces respectively.

\section{Polyhedral CGM}
The Polyhedral CGM can be easily constructed from 2D polygonal cells that
define the 2D surface of a polyhedron, and the 2D polygonal cells that
define the 2D surface of a polyhedron can be easily extracted from this
representation. Each planar map of the basic CGM data structure represents
a portion of the polyhedron surface-boundary with overlaps between the planar
maps. We project the normals of each facet of the polyhedron onto the faces of
the unit cube. A planar map is formed on each face of the unit cube as follows:
Each interesection of a polyhedron facet-normal with a cube face defines a
vertex in the planar map associated with that face. We connect vertices that
are generated by normals of adjacent facets. This forms a planar map bounded by
a unit square on each unit-cube face.

\section{Spherical CGM}

\section{Implementation Details}
When reducing the 3D coordinate system onto a 2D coordinate system attached
to a paerticular unit-cube face, we project the 3D coordinate system as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Unit-Cube Face & Projection\\
\hline
$0$ & $X,Y,Z \Rightarrow Y,Z$\\
$1$ & $X,Y,Z \Rightarrow Z,X$\\
$2$ & $X,Y,Z \Rightarrow X,Y$\\
$3$ & $X,Y,Z \Rightarrow Z,Y$\\
$4$ & $X,Y,Z \Rightarrow X,Z$\\
$5$ & $X,Y,Z \Rightarrow Y,X$\\
\end{tabular}

As mentioned above each planar map is bounded by a 2-unit square centered at
the origin of a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. Each 2D vertex and 2D edge of
the boundary is indexed as depicted below:
