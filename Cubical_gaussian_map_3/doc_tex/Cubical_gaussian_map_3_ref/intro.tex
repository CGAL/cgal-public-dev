\subsection*{Introduction}

{\em Cubical Gaussian Map} is a data dtructure that represents a Gaussinal map
mapped onto a unit cube (an axes parallel cube centered at the origin whose
edges are of length two). The representation consists of six planar maps that
correspond to the six faces of the unit cube.
