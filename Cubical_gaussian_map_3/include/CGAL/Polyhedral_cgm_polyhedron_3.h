/*! \file
 * Related definition of a Polyhedron_3 data structure, an instance of which
 * can be used to initialize a Polyhedral_cgm data structure.
 * A user can construct a Polyhedral_cgm data structure in two ways as follows:
 * 1. Providing a sequence of (geometric) points in three dimensions and a
 * sequence of indices into the points that indicate the facets of the
 * polyhedron. An index equal to -1 indicates the end of a facet. Internally,
 * a temporary Polyhedron_3 object is constructed from the input. Then, the
 * Polyhedral_cgm object is constructed from the Polyhedron_3 object. Finally,
 * the temporary Polyhedron_3 object is destructed.
 * 2. Providing a Polyhedron_3 object directly. In this case, the type
 * is constrained. The user is free to define her/his own vertex, halfedge,
 * and face types, but they must derive from the types provided in this file,
 * namely:
 *   Polyhedral_cgm_polyhedron_3_vertex,
 *   Polyhedral_cgm_polyhedron_3_halfedge, and
 *   Polyhedral_cgm_polyhedron_3_face.
 * Notice that the latter is parameterized with a Cgm type, the same type
 * as the type Polyhedral_cgm that, and object of which the user intends to
 * construct.
