\cgalPkgDescriptionEnd

A subset \f$S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \f$ is convex if for any two points `p` and `q`
in the set the line segment with endpoints `p` and `q` is contained in \f$ S \f$.
The convex hull of a set \f$ S \f$ is the smallest convex set containing \f$ S \f$.
The convex hull of a set of points `P` is a convex polygon with vertices in `P`.
A point in `P` is an extreme point (with respect to `P`) if it is a vertex
of the convex hull of `P`.

The Ray_3-Bilinear_patch_3 intersection parity test presumes that neither object is degenerate
and that the origin of the ray does not lie on the patch. Degeneracy is given as a precondition
in the function itself, but testing for the origin on the patch is not.
