The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 4.13 Beta 1
of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.


CGAL version 4.13 Beta 1 is a public testing release. It should provide
a solid ground to report bugs that need to be tackled before the
release of the final version of CGAL 4.13 in September.

Besides fixes and general enhancement to existing packages, the following
has changed since CGAL 4.12:


### 3D Periodic Mesh Generation (new package)

-   This package generates 3-dimensional periodic meshes. It computes
    isotropic simplicial meshes for domains described through implicit
    functional boundaries over the flat torus (which can also seen in
    the Euclidean space as a periodic cube). The output is a periodic
    3D mesh of the domain volume and conformal surface meshes for all
    the boundary and subdividing surfaces.  The package is closely
    related to the 3D Mesh Generation package, with similar concepts,
    classes, and API.


### Classification 

-   This package can now handle classification of surface meshes and
    clusters, and can compute features in parallel.

changes.


The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations, Delaunay triangulations
  and periodic triangulations in 2D and 3D),
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- regularized Boolean operations on polygons with curved arcs
- arrangements of curves,
- mesh generation (2D, 3D and surface mesh generation,
  surface mesh subdivision and parametrization),
- alpha shapes (in 2D and 3D),
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD),
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon),
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and
  range and segment trees),
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of
  streamlines),
- optimization algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal
  component analysis).
