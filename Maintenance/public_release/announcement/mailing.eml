Subject: CGAL 4.14 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Body: 

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 4.14
of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.

This release will be the last one supporting C++98/C++03 compilers,
and the next release, CGAL version 5.0, will require support for
C++14.

Besides fixes and general enhancement to existing packages, the
following has changed since CGAL 4.13:


### 2D Periodic Hyperbolic Triangulations (new package)

-   This package allows the computation of Delaunay triangulations of
    the Bolza surface.  The Bolza surface is the most symmetric
    hyperbolic surface of genus 2. Its fundamental domain is the
    regular hyperbolic octagon with angles π/4 centered at the origin
    of the Poincaré disk. Triangulations of the Bolza surface can be
    seen as triangulations of the hyperbolic plane that are periodic
    in the four directions defined by the sides of this regular
    octagon.

### 2D Hyperbolic Triangulations (new package)

-   This package allows the computation of Delaunay Triangulations of
    sets of points in the Poincaré disk, which is one of the
    conformal models for the hyperbolic plane.

### The Heat Method (new package)

-   This package provides an algorithm that solves the single- or
    multiple-source shortest path problem by returning an
    approximation of the geodesic distance for all vertices of a
    triangle mesh to the closest vertex in a given set of source
    vertices.

### Triangulated Surface Mesh Approximation (new package)

-   This package implements the Variational Shape Approximation method
    to approximate an input surface triangle mesh by a simpler surface
    triangle mesh.

changes.


The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations, Delaunay triangulations
  and periodic triangulations in 2D and 3D),
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- regularized Boolean operations on polygons with curved arcs
- arrangements of curves,
- mesh generation (2D, 3D and surface mesh generation,
  surface mesh subdivision and parametrization),
- alpha shapes (in 2D and 3D),
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD),
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon),
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and
  range and segment trees),
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of
  streamlines),
- optimization algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal
  component analysis).
