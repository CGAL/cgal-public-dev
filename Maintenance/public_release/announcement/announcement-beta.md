The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 5.2 Beta 1 of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.

CGAL version 5.2 Beta 1 is a public testing release. It should provide a solid ground to report bugs that need to be tackled before the release of the final version of CGAL 5.2 in December 2020.

Fixes, improvements, and various small features have been added since CGAL 5.1. See https://www.cgal.org/2020/11/18/cgal52-beta1/ for a complete list of changes.
