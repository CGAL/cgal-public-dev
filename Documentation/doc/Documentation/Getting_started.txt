\page general_intro Getting Started

- \subpage installation describes how to install %CGAL, and lists the third party libraries on which %CGAL depends, or for which %CGAL provides interfaces. 

- \subpage introduction presents you some short example programs to
  get a first idea for the look and feel of a program that uses \cgal.
  We introduce the notion of the \em kernel which defines geometric primitives,
  the notion of  <em>traits classes</em> which define what primitives are used
  by a geometric algorithm, the notions of \em concept and \em model.
  
- \subpage manual gives an idea where you should look for documentation.
  The documentation for a class, may be spread over manual pages of
  base classes, and reference manual pages of concepts the class is a model of.
  

- \subpage preliminaries lists the licenses under which the %CGAL datastructures and algorithms are distributed, how to control inlining, thread safety, code deprecation, checking of pre- and postconditions, and how to alter the failure behavior.
