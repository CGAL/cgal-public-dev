\section LOD_Extra Second Version with Graph Cut

This version includes several steps:
- identify wall points - points with horizontal normal vectors;
- project these points in 2D;
- apply region growing to detect linear regions;
- fit segments to the detected regions;
- apply the shortest path algorithm to merge close segments and get subcontours;
- close holes between subcontours if any using the graphcut algorithm;
- extract triangulation and holes if any;
- extract the polygon with holes.
