\section Section_Octree_Introduction Introduction

An octree is a commonly used data structure that subdivides 3d space.
The Octree package provides the Octree and Node classes.

\section Section_Octree_Examples Examples

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Point_Set Building an Octree from a Point_set_3

This example illustrates how to create an octree from a `Point_set_3` loaded from a file.

An octree is constructed from the point set and its map.
The tree is refined with a max-depth (deepest node allowed) of 10,
and a bucket size (maximum number of points contained by a single node) of 20.
The tree is then printed to the standard output.

\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_build_from_Point_set.cpp}

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Point_Vector Building an Octree from a Vector of Points

This example illustrates how to create an octree from a collection of points that isn't a `Point_set_3`.
It also shows a more explicit way of setting the split criteria when refining the tree.

An `std::vector<Point_3>` is manually filled with points.
The vector is used as the point map, and ...
\todo How should I create the point index vector?

\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_build_from_Point_vector.cpp}

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Custom_Split_Criterion Building an Octree with a Custom Split_criterion

This example illustrates how to refine an octree using a split criterion that isn't provided by default.

The criterion is a functor created by the user to determine whether a node needs to be split.
This particular criterion sets a node's bucket size as a ratio of its depth.
For example, for a ratio of 2, a node at depth 2 can hold 4 points, a node at depth 7 can hold 14.

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Nearest_Neighbor Finding the Nearest Neighbor of a Point

This example illustrates how to use an octree to accelerate the search for points close to a location.

Points are loaded from a file and an octree is built.
The nearest neighbor method is invoked for several input points.
A k value of 1 is used to find the single closest point.
Results are put in a vector, and then printed.

e.g. I've built a tree and I want to use it to find the nearest point to a specific location
\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_find_nearest_neighbor.cpp}

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Manual_Traveral Manual Traversal

e.g. I have a reference to the root node of a tree, and I want a reference to a specific child
\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_traversal_manual.cpp}

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Preorder_Traversal Preorder Traversal

e.g. I've build a tree and I want to print it out (parents before children)
\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_traversal_preorder.cpp}

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Custom_Traversal Using a Custom Traversal Method

e.g. I've build a tree and I want to print it out, but layer by layer
\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_traversal_custom.cpp}
