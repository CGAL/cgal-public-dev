\section Section_Octree_Introduction Introduction

An octree is a commonly used data structure that subdivides 3d space.
The Octree package provides the Octree and Node classes.

\section Section_Octree Octree

\section Section_Octree_Examples Examples

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Point_Set Building an Octree from a Point_set_3

This example illustrates how to create an octree from a `Point_set_3` loaded from a file.

An octree is constructed from the point set and its map.
The tree is refined with a max-depth (deepest node allowed) of 10,
and a bucket size (maximum number of points contained by a single node) of 20.
The tree is then printed to the standard output.

\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_build_from_Point_set.cpp}

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Point_Vector Building an Octree from a Vector of Points

e.g. I have a collection of points contained by an `std::vector<Point_3>`, and I want to build a tree from it.
\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_build_from_Point_vector.cpp}

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Custom_Split_Criterion Building an Octree with a Custom Split_criterion

e.g. I want to build an octree with a split criterion that isn't provided
\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_build_with_custom_split.cpp}

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Nearest_Neighbor Finding the Nearest Neighbor of a Point

e.g. I've built a tree and I want to use it to find the nearest point to a specific location
\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_find_nearest_neighbor.cpp}

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Manual_Traveral Manual Traversal

e.g. I have a reference to the root node of a tree, and I want a reference to a specific child
\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_traversal_manual.cpp}

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Preorder_Traversal Preorder Traversal

e.g. I've build a tree and I want to print it out (parents before children)
\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_traversal_preorder.cpp}

\subsection Section_Octree_Example_Custom_Traversal Using a Custom Traversal Method

e.g. I've build a tree and I want to print it out, but layer by layer
\cgalExample{Octree/Octree_traversal_custom.cpp}

\section Section_Octree_Performance Performance
