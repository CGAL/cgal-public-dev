Todo:
1. Refactor the LOD reconstruction class.
2. Make the final LOD result (polyhedron) a valid manifold mesh.
3. Refactor all steps of the pipeline.
4. Check in each class that I do not have duplicated input points or handle these duplications.
5. Reimplement the polygonizer class of Jean-Philippe.
6. Fix the Eigen diagonalize traits. Why do we have different results when using Eigen in the pipeline?
