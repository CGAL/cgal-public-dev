\section gbc_introduction Introduction

Barycentric coordinates are an important tool in computer graphics and geometric modeling. 
Originally, these coordinates were used to represent a given point with respect to a simplex but have been later
 generalized to more complex shapes.

The package 3D Generalized Barycentric Coordinates offers an efficient and robust implementation 
of three-dimensional closed-form generalized barycentric coordinates defined for convex simplicial polytopes.

In particular, this package includes an implementation of Wachspress, discrete harmonic, mean value, and
 one extra function to calculate barycentric coordinates with respect to tetrahedrons.


\section gbc_interface Software Design

Wachspress, discrete harmonic, and mean value coordinates are all generalized barycentric coordinates 
that can be computed analytically. In this implementation, we restrict our polyhedra to convex ones 
with triangular faces, although some of the coordinates may accept more general shapes. 

All of the three barycentric coordinates can be computed either by instantiating a class or through a 
free function. Tetrahedron coordinates can be computed only through the free function. 

We can specify a computation policy Barycentric_coordinates::Computation_policy_3 that can be FAST or 
FAST_WITH_EDGE_CASES for each of the three coordinates. The difference between them is that FAST_WITH_EDGE_CASES
 treats points near the boundaries by projecting them into the face of the polyhedron and then calculating triangle coordinates.

The output of a query point is the coordinate value with respect to each vertex, the number of coordinate
 values is the same as the number of vertices, and the ordering is also the same.

All class and function templates are parameterized by a traits class, which is a model of the concept 
BarycentricTraits_3. It provides all necessary geometric primitives, predicates, and constructions, 
which are required for the computation. All models of Kernel can be used. A polyhedron is provided as 
a model of the concept FaceListGraph with a property map that maps a vertex from the polyhedron to CGAL::Point_3.


\section gbc_examples Examples

In order to facilitate the process of learning this package, we provide various examples
with a basic usage of different barycentric components.


\subsection tetra_example Tetrahedron Coordinates

In this example, we use the global function tetrahedron_coordinates_in_tuple(). 
We compute coordinates for the tetrahedron whose vertices are the points in the 
set {(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)}. Were used points inside, outside and 
at the boundary of the tetrahedron.

\subsection wp_example Wachspress Coordinates

In this example, we generate 250 random points inside a unitary sphere, 
centered at the origin, then we take the convex hull of this set of points 
and use this as our polyhedron. Finally, we calculate Wachspress coordinates 
for all of these 250 points.

\subsection dh_example Discrete Harmonic Coordinates

This is an example that shows how to deform a simple smooth sphere into 
another shape, topologically equivalent. To achieve this, we enclose the 
sphere inside a cube cage, then we calculate the barycentric 
coordinate of each vertex with respect to the cube cage. After deforming 
the cage, we calculate the linear combination of the points to get the 
deformed sphere vertices.

\subsection mv_example Mean Value Coordinates

This example is very similar to the one used with tetrahedron coordinates. 
We started with a regular icosahedron and for points inside, outside and 
at the boundary, we calculate mean value coordinates. In this example, we 
use the fast with edge cases algorithm because it treats points very close 
to the boundaries.
