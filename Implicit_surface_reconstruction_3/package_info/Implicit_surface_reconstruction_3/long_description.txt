Implicit Surface Reconstruction from Point Sets

Pierre Alliez, Laurent Saboret, Gael Guennebaud, Tong Zhao

This CGAL package implements 2 implicit surface reconstruction methods: Poisson Surface Reconstruction and Spectral Surface Reconstruction. The input is an unorganized point set with oriented normals (Poisson) / unoriented normals (Spectral). The output is either an implicit function (ready for evaluation by any contouring algorithm), or a surface mesh generated by the CGAL surface mesh generator.
