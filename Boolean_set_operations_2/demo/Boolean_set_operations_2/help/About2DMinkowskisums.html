    <h1>2D Minkowski sums</h1>
    <br><br>&nbsp;<img src='resources/crushed.png'><br><br>
    Given two sets P,Q∈R<sup>d</sup>, their Minkowski sum, denoted by P⊕Q, is their point-wise sum, namely the set {p+q | p∈P,q∈Q}. Minkowski sums are used in many applications, such as motion planning and computer-aided design and manufacturing. This package contains functions that compute the planar Minkowski sums of two polygons. (Here, A and B are two closed polygons in R<sup>2</sup>, which may have holes), and the planar Minkowski sum of a simple polygon and a disc—an operation also referred to as offsetting or dilating a polygon. This package, like the 2D Regularized Boolean Set-Operations package, is implemented on top of the arrangement infrastructure provided by the 2D Arrangements package. The two packages are integrated well to allow mixed operations. For example, it is possible to apply Boolean set operations on objects that are the result of Minkowski sum computations.<br>
