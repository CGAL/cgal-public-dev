Add Polyline support as mentioned in include/todo.txt

Ask Efi about how he wants the interface.
My preference will be to keep everything as it is just add a new option in file menu to create a window for a particular curve as
operations between different curves are not possible.
Currently the demo is very confusing. Buckets and all. It is very confusing. Simplify it for everyone.

Add about CGAL,Minkowski sum in the about button in the taskbar

Add functionality to console(It will be written in C++)

Add the information box as it is in the polyhedron demo(to be addressed by Efi first)
