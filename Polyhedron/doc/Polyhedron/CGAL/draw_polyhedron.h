Open a new window and draw `apoly`, an instance of the `CGAL::Polyhedron_3` class. The function is blocking, that is the program continues as soon as the user closes the window. This function requires CGAL_Qt5, and is only available if the flag CGAL_USE_BASIC_VIEWER is defined at compile time.
\tparam POLY an instance of the `CGAL::Polyhedron_3` class.
\param apoly the polyhedron to draw.
