1. To make the code parallel. Get iteration number from the thread. Add parallel class to each type of the coordinate functions. Use begin() + offset. Resize vector. Parallel class takes as parameters list of points and polygon. Use random access iterator. - Done but we have problems with it.

2. Add hard tests with epsilon distance away from the polygonâ€™s boundary, which we have discussed during our first group meeting, to current test suit.
