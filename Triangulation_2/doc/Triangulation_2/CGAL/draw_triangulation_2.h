Open a new window and draw `at2`, a model of the `TriangulationDataStructure_2` concept. The function is blocking, that is the program continues as soon as the user closes the window. This function requires CGAL_Qt5, and is only available if the flag CGAL_USE_BASIC_VIEWER is defined at compile time.
\tparam T2 a model of the `TriangulationDataStructure_2` concept.
\param at2 the triangulation to draw.
