Full list

Validity:
- Test correctness of covariance matrix (via eigenvalues)
  -> change API to get the covariance matrix
- Test stability of closed forms under partitioning refinement/clustering
  with identical type of primitives
  with different types of primitives: eg iso cuboid split into
- Test convergence of closed forms under refinement: eg generate more and more points inside an iso rectangle, etc.
tetrahedra and vice-versa.
  only possible for segments, isocuboids, tetrahedra, triangles
- Test correctness of fitting line/planes (generate primitives whose centroid and best fitting primitive are known)
- Cover more kernels
- Detect primitives with Nan as coordinates -> assertion
- Detect primitives whose sum of lens/areas/volumes is zero, as the centroid may be indefinite in this case -> assertion

SIMON
- Accuracy of iso-cuboids 2D & 3D
 TOFIX: closed form integral for dim-2 cuboid-3: check formulas
- Kernel coverage including EPEK -> done
- Adding assertions: non-degenerate measures (areas or volumes)
- Iterator facade from boost

CEDRIC-PIERRE
- Test stability of centroids and closed forms under partitioning refinement/clustering
  - only possible for segments, isocuboids, tetrahedra, triangles
  - how to measure distance between two lines ? planes ? compare projections of sample points instead.
  - check if partitioning is ok
  - inclure Simon PL
  - check closed centroids stability
  - check covariance matrice (norme L2)

- Test correctness of covariance matrix / order-2 moment with respect to origin
  - consistency with closed forms of article

- Test convergence of closed forms under refinement: monotonous
  - triangle - points -> sample a surface mesh uniformly
  - volume - points -> sample a volume

TODO
- Remove PCA_util
- compute_moment_2 in compute_moment_2.h
- compute_moment_3 in compute_moment_3.h
- fitting_plane_3.h
- fitting_line_2.h
- fitting_line_3.h
- generic convergence test
