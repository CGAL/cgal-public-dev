Validity:
- Test correctness of covariance matrix (via eigenvalues)
  -> change API to get the covariance matrix
- Test stability of closed forms under partitioning refinement/clustering 
  with identical type of primitives
  with different types of primitives: eg iso cuboid split into 
- Test convergence of closed forms under refinement: eg generate more and more points inside an iso rectangle, etc.
tetrahedra and vice-versa.
  only possible for segments, isocuboids, tetrahedra, triangles
- Test correctness of fitting line/planes (generate primitives whose centroid and best fitting primitive are known)
- Cover more kernels
- Detect primitives with Nan as coordinates -> assertion
- Detect primitives whose sum of lens/areas/volumes is zero, as the centroid may be indefinite in this case -> assertion


SIMON
- Accuracy of iso-cuboids 2D & 3D
- Kernel coverage
- Adding assertions: non-degenerate measures (areas or volumes)

CEDRIC-PIERRE
- Test stability of closed forms under partitioning refinement/clustering 
  - only possible for segments, isocuboids, tetrahedra, triangles
- Test convergence of closed forms under refinement: monotonous
  - triangle - points -> sample a surface mesh uniformly
  - volume - points -> sample a volume
- Test correctness of covariance matrix / order-2 moment with respect to origin
  - consistency with closed forms of article
